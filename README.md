I developed this code for study purposes and not for malicious intent, so I do not assume any responsibility for any harm it may cause.
Be careful not to run it on your own machine. I recommend that you adjust the target according to your needs and run it on a virtual machine to prevent future damage.
This is my first project, so I welcome any kind of criticism that can help me improve future ones.

**After the file "UnderCarpet.py" runs the entire code to encrypt all files and folders in the specified directory you chose in lines 67 and 68, it will open the following screen:**

**I set it up as a kind of "button," so if you click on the binary numbers, they change color, giving it an easy and distinctive style. 
Now, if you click on the "mask," it will open the second screen, which is this one:**

****The code is completely open for you to be free to modify, and if you want to enhance it, feel free to do so. If you have any tips that can make it more effective, I am willing to listen as well. I am a beginner hacker programmer, but I am open to criticism to evolve mentally as a future hacker.****
