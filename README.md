I developed this code for study purposes and not for malicious intent, so I do not assume any responsibility for any harm it may cause.
Be careful not to run it on your own machine. I recommend that you adjust the target according to your needs and run it on a virtual machine to prevent future damage.
This is my first project, so I welcome any kind of criticism that can help me improve future ones.
